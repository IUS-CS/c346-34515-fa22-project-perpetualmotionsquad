# Project Vision

For people who are looking into taking a flight who need to know what hotels and restaurants are near their landing location, The Control Tower is a web-based service that provides users with information on flights coming in and out of their local airports while also providing details on amenities around where they will land. Unlike other web pages our product provides users with valuable details in addition to the flight information they originally came for.

The webpage will use the .net framework and C# for the backend and React and Next.js for the front end.
