* Added a "Find Flights" button.
* Created the architecture document.
* Created sprint 1 minutes doc.
* Added a link to an about page that is currently just a placeholder.

## Retro
[What is a Sprint Retrospective](https://www.scrum.org/resources/what-is-a-sprint-retrospective)

### Good
* Continuing to learn the technologies needed for the project.
* Homepage came together well.
* Most tasks that we planned were completed.

### Bad
* Miscommuniation resulted in two people creating a home page. This resulted in us combining features from both and taking the better version.
* Had trouble getting meetings scheduled due to the group's schedules.
* Didn't finish final tasks planned for the sprint.

### Actionable Commitments
* Set specific meeting dates to facilitate better communication and planning.
* Meetings planned for Monday 9pm.
* We plan to divide our tasks more efficiently.
